          Michael I. Jordan, born in the United States, is a leading researcher
          in machine learning and artificial intelligence. He started his career
          when he discovered the field of cognitive science during a visit to
          the University of California. After Jordan earned a Ph.D. in cognitive
          science, he spent time at MIT before joining University of California
          in 1998. As a professor in University of California, he obtained the
          Pehong Chen Distinguished Professorship. Through his research, he
          helped bridge computer science with cognitive science, helping lead to
          the development of more sophisticated AI systems. Because of his work
          in machine learning and cognitive science, he has received numerous
          honors, including the David E. Rumelhart Prize and the John von
          Neumann Medal.
